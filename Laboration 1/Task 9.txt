I knew pretty much nothing to begin with so most of the things in this lab are new to me which taught me alot.
Because of this some things where a bit difficult at first such as, printf_s and scanf_s.
But to learn anything I didn't know I just googled it, read lecture notes or asked classmates.
I found the lab itself to be very good by testing a wide veriety of things.
The biggest issue I had to get over was getting the required programs to work. 
It took me atleast 8 hours just to try to get everything to work
and in the end github still doesn't work propperly with syncing for me.

In total I've probably spent atleast 25 hours on the lab, (not counting the trouble with the git and visual studio), mostly because I knew barely anything about c++ going into it.
